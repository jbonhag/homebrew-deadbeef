# homebrew-deadbeef

This is an unofficial homebrew repository for the
[DeaDBeeF](https://deadbeef.sourceforge.io/) audio player. It's basically the
same as `deadbeef-devel` in
[homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask), but it pins the
application to a release version which makes it easier to build plugins
against.
